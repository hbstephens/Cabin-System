* Cabin Software - This is the main module which is downloaded into
*       the Cabin System 68HC11 for execution.   The Cabin Software
*       provides a basis for remotely monitoring the Cabin Sensors.
*       In addition, the Cabin Software provides a transparent 
*       interface to the CP290 for direct power control of lights,
*       equipment, etc via the X10 system.   The Cabin Software also
*       provides a history of the weather information collected by
*       the Cabin System.    Local display operations are provided 
*       using a LCD panel which can monitor the sensors directly.
